<h1>Who Makes America?</h1>
<div>
<p>On March 27th, 1999 my parents became naturalized citizens in the United States of America. I was born two months later. I recently discovered this information while I was sifting through my parents documents, back at home as a result of the pandemic. I already knew the story of their arrival. On a sweltering June day in 1992, clad in everything that they couldn’t squeeze into their suitcases, my family entered John F. Kennedy International Airport. Seven years later I was born. They came here with next to nothing (they had less than 100 dollars to their name and three suitcases). My parents eventually settled in upstate New York, bought a house and achieved that particular American dream of 2.5 kids and house with a car in the garage. 

	<br><br>

Americans love this story. We love to hear how someone pulled themselves up by their bootstraps and through hard work and perseverance made all of their dreams come true. America also despises immigrants. Historically there has been opposition to every immigrant group that resettled in America, from the Know-Nothing party opposing Irish and German immigrants in the 1800s to the internment of Japanese Americans to recent history in which migrants seeking asylum were put into detention centers and children were separated from their parents. While some Americans refuse to acknowledge the contributions of immigrant labor, the truth is that in 2018, in New York alone <a href="https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/immigrants/downloads/pdf/moia_annual_report_2018_final.pdf">immigrants contributed about 22% of the city's total GDP.</a>  

<br><br>

The initial success of immigrant children seems promising. According to a 2015 study outlined in <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2015/04/second-generation-immigrants-outperform-others-in-school/431943/">The Atlantic</a> <b>"second-generation students outperform first-generation students on standardized tests and third-generation immigrants on school grades."  </b> </p>

<p> The chart below illustrates how while foreign born Americans are less likely to graduate highschool or college than those who are born in the U.S., the children of immigrants are more likely to obtain a bachelor's degree than their peers whose parents are from the U.S. </p> 

<p>
<iframe title="Educational Attainment (ages 25+)" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-t4PKs" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/t4PKs/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="border: none;" width="715" height="622"></iframe> </p>

<p>This information fits into the narrative of the American dream. By coming to America, your children are better off, and therefore they will be more successful and high achieving. The reality is that children with immigrant parents not only act as a bridge between their families and their external culture, but also shoulder the burden of their parents' expectations. My mother sums it up with "we didn't come to America for you to get a B+ in English". In comparison to the menial labor my mother had to do when she arrived in the United States, how could the stresses of my privileged life as an American teenager compare. Second generation children are pressured to succeed in order to overcompensate for their parents and to make their parents sacrifice seem “worthwhile” </p>



<p> However, as this <a href="https://newrepublic.com/article/120352/why-americanization-makes-immigrant-children-less-successful">study</a> suggests, the reality is that immigrant children still struggle to achieve their own American dream. </p>



<p class ="block"> <b> "The longer immigrant children live in this country, the worse, on average, their health, their attitude, and their school performance. What's more, with each subsequent generation, immigrant children do worse and worse. On average, first-generation children function at significantly higher levels than do typical American-born children. But, by the third generation, that advantage is gone."</b></p>

<p> 
While the chart above shows how immigrant children can surpass their American counterparts, later generations tend to graduate highschool and college at the same rate as those without immigrant grandparents. 

<br><br>

I am a second generation immigrant who is grappling with the painful reality that I might not be as successful as my parents. I wanted to know if other second generation immigrants felt the same way. 
<br><br>


I spoke with a few second-generation immigrants from different backgrounds to learn more about the their experiences vary and how they stay the same, regardless of ethnic or socioeconomic background. Gabby Francis, a 21 year-old student from Astoria, Queens was the first child born to her parents after they moved to America from Trinidad and Tobago. Gabby describes the struggles she faced while growing up. She says “ I think the best way to sum it up was an identity crisis, it was constantly trying to find a place to belong. When you're displaced, it's really hard to do that.”
<br><br>

Gabby continues to describe her childhood and the duality of being second gen: 
<br>

<p class ="block2"> <b>“I was kind of living a double life, essentially acting like this American kid at school and tried to fit in and eat peanut butter and jelly sandwiches because everyone did. But at home even like curry and rice, and roti and stuff that I didn't bring to school because I was ashamed of it for a really long time.” </b></p>

<br><br>

<p> Indeed, many second generation immigrants make a significant effort to assimilate, and succeed in doing so. The chart below shows how, while first generation Hispanic and Asian Americans would decribe themselves as "very different from a typical American" by the second generation, a majority of both immigrant groups say that they are "a typical American."

<br><br>

But Adrian, a 20 year old whose parents met in California after moving from Mexico, says that the popular narrative doesn't tell the whole story. </p> 

<img src="adrian.jpg" alt="Portrait of Adrian" align="left" hspace="25" vspace="25" style="width:200px;height:230px;">

<p class="block2"> <b> "I've never really related to a lot of [the narrative], because a lot of it is very stuck. It's like,'oh, yeah, my parents immigrated for a better life. And they, you know, they had me and I made sure to not mess up or be a bad kid, because I didn't want to make their decisions and sacrifices go to waste. All of that is true, I think, you know, on like, a very superficial level. A lot of immigrant kids experienced that. But I think there's a lot of nuances to the experience that differs from kid to kid." </b></p>

<br>

<p> Adrian is right. There are a lot of nuances that impact the immigrant experience, including the success rates of second generation children. For example, if one your parents, like Adrian's, is not a naturalized citizen, it can lead to instability at home, or difficulty finding employment or securing housing. If like me, your parents are white, chances are that they are less likely to be unemployed, regardless of citizenship status. During March of 2020 over 18% of all Hispanic immigrants were unemployed, more than any other immigrant group.  </p>

<iframe title="Employment Status by Immigrant Generation" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-KApWL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/KApWL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();

<br><br>

<p> Education is often seen as the path for upward social and economic mobility, especially amongst immigrants.  When asked how she balanced her parents expectations with her own mental health, Gabby says "they don't really see it the way that you see it. You know, sometimes homework is a lot.  Sometimes it's really stressful, it's a demand for your brain and your body to constantly produce this kind of work. And my parents don't necessarily understand that they're just like, either you're capable, or there's no reason you should be complaining." When you break down immigrant groups, you find that while the second generation is generally more succesful than the first, this result varies when you consider race. The disparity is especially stark when comparing at Black adults in the second and thirs generation. While 40% of second generation Black adults achieve a bachelor's degree or more, by the second generation this number shrinks to 20%. White and Hispanic immigrant generations also follow the same pattern. 

<br><br>

</p>

<iframe title="Educational Attainment of 2nd and 3rd Generation Immigrants" aria-label="Dot Plot" id="datawrapper-chart-8q5BP" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/8q5BP/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="242"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>


<p> Additionally while median income rises as you progress generationally for white and Asian immigrants and their children, for Hispanic immigrants there is an increase in the second generation, but by the third generation the median income has decreased. For Black immigrants the median income follows a downward trend. 

<br><br>

<iframe title="Household annual income (in dollars)" aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-1QnRL" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/1QnRL/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="621"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

</p>

<p> Finally, this trend is echoed in the amount of adults in poverty. Black and Hispanic adults, regardless of immigrant generation, have higher levels of poverty than white or Asian immigrants and their children. Once again, third generation Hispanic immigrants are more likely to live in poverty than their second generation counterparts. Third generation Black adults are more likely to live in poverty than their first generation grandparents. 

    <br><br>

<iframe title="Percent of Adults in Poverty by Immigrant Generation " aria-label="chart" id="datawrapper-chart-TcLGT" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/TcLGT/3/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="400"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(a){if(void 0!==a.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var e in a.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.getElementById("datawrapper-chart-"+e)||document.querySelector("iframe[src*='"+e+"']");t&&(t.style.height=a.data["datawrapper-height"][e]+"px")}}))}();
</script>

</p>

<p>So, what does this data say about us? Well for starters, the American dream is a myth, and not everyone who comes here has an equal opportunity for success, which translates to their children as well. Immigrants cannot escape systemic racism that runs rampant through every facet of this country. The only way to move forward if is if we recognize these issues and try to make America work for the people who live here now. My mother still calls me her American dream, perhaps one day that vision for the future will become real. Or not.  We'll see how 2020 works out. </p>
